# PygameSnake2D

A simple 2D platformer game (Snake) using Pygame library in Python

Here's how the code works:
We import the necessary modules: pygame for the game library and random for generating random food positions.
We initialize Pygame and set up the game window with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels.
We define colors for the background, snake, and food.
We set up game variables such as the snake size, snake speed, initial snake position, and snake body.
We initialize the food position randomly on the game window.
We set up the game loop variables and define movement directions.
We enter the game loop, which continues until the game is over.
Inside the game loop, we handle events such as quitting the game or changing the snake's direction based on keyboard input.
We move the snake in the current direction and update the snake body.
